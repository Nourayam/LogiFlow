Integrate Final Feature Enhancements & User Experience Polish

You previously implemented the core architecture of a React-based algorithm visualisation platform. This follow-up prompt outlines final refinements and UX-focused improvements to ensure production readiness and educational clarity.

Please update or supplement the existing implementation with the following features and improvements:

---

ðŸŽ¯ Functionality Additions

1. **Loading States**
   - Display a loader or spinner while frame generation is in progress.
   - Disable controls until frames are ready.

2. **Algorithm Descriptions**
   - Add brief educational blurbs per algorithm, visible in a description box or tooltip.
   - Include space and time complexity using British spelling conventions.

3. **Keyboard Shortcuts**
   - Add global key bindings:  
     - `Space` to play/pause  
     - `ArrowRight` to step forward  
     - `ArrowLeft` to step backward

4. **Export/Import Visualisation State**
   - Enable saving current progress as JSON or state snapshot.
   - Implement a way to reload it into the canvas for review.

5. **Testing**
   - Add unit tests for each algorithmâ€™s frame generator logic.
   - Add integration tests for control interactions and rendering flow.

âœ… Final Deployment Checklist

Please ensure the following are verified in implementation or covered via error-safe logic:

- All core algorithms function correctly: Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, BFS, DFS, TreeOps
- Edge cases handled: empty array, single element, duplicates, already sorted, reverse sorted
- Responsive layout renders appropriately on:
   - Mobile viewports
   - Tablet dimensions
   - Desktop viewports
- Performance scales with large arrays (100+ items) or dense graphs
- Accessibility support:
   - Keyboard navigation
   - Screen reader readability
   - Sufficient colour contrast

ðŸ§ª Notes

- Any new components or logic should align with existing modular design.
- Use British spelling in all user-facing labels and comments.
- Prefer using reusable hooks or context state where applicable.

This update should ensure the visualiser is polished for live demos, portfolio showcases, and educational use.
