Based on the files shown, this appears to be a React application for visualizing algorithms (like sorting algorithms and graph traversals). Here are the steps to get this program up and running:

### Prerequisites:
1. Make sure you have Node.js installed (version 16 or higher recommended)
2. npm or yarn package manager (comes with Node.js)

### Steps to Run the Application:

1. **Open a terminal** in the project directory (`C:/Users/noura/OneDrive/Desktop/Projects/algorvis`)

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   or if you use yarn:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   or with yarn:
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

4. **Open the application**:
   The terminal should output a URL (typically http://localhost:5173). Open this in your browser.

### How to Use the Application:
1. Select an algorithm from the dropdown (e.g., "Bubble Sort")
2. Enter numbers separated by commas in the input field (e.g., "5, 3, 8, 4, 2")
3. Click "Visualize" to see the algorithm in action
4. Use the controls to:
   - Play/Pause the visualization
   - Step through frame by frame
   - Adjust the speed
   - Reset the visualization

### Additional Commands:
- To build for production:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
- To preview the production build:
  ```bash
  npm run preview
  ```

### Troubleshooting:
1. If you get dependency errors, try:
   ```bash
   npm install --force
   ```
2. If the port is busy, you can specify a different port:
   ```bash
   npm run dev -- --port 3000
   ```

The application appears to be built with Vite + React, which provides fast development server and hot module replacement (changes will reflect immediately in the browser).
