Based on your description and the code you've shared, it seems like your algorithm visualization app isn't displaying properly. Let me help you troubleshoot this:

1. First Issue - File Path Mismatch:
   - You mentioned seeing a Vite + React page with just a counter
   - Looking at your files, I notice you have `App.js` but in a Vite + React project, the main file should typically be `App.jsx`
   - The counter you're seeing is likely from a default Vite template

2. Solution Steps:

a) Rename your main file:
```bash
mv App.js App.jsx
```

b) Make sure your project structure matches this:
```
src/
  ├── App.jsx
  ├── main.jsx
  ├── components/
  ├── algorithms/
  ├── utils/
  └── index.css
```

c) Check your `main.jsx` (it should look something like this):
```jsx
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
import App from './App'
import './index.css'

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
)
```

3. Additional Checks:

- Make sure all your component files have the correct extensions (`.jsx` for components)
- Verify you have all required dependencies installed. Your `package.json` should include:
  ```json
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0"
  }
  ```

4. If you're still having issues, try these commands:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app should now show your algorithm visualizer interface with:
- A left panel with algorithm selection and input controls
- A main visualization area showing the array elements
- Control buttons at the bottom

If you're still seeing issues, please:
1. Share your project structure (`ls -R` output)
2. Share your `main.jsx` and `index.html` files
3. Let me know if you see any errors in the browser console or terminal
